Finnlands relies entirely upon our Adoption Fees, Donations and grants (when we can get them) to provide for the animals under our care.  Your generosity helps us to help them; even $1 makes a difference.  Below are links to our Wish Lists at Chewy and Amazon, as well as other ways to donate.  We cannot thank you enough for your help!
